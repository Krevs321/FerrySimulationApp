# FerrySimulationApp

For running the simulation start programTest.cs. That will start the simulation and show you random vehicles arrving on the ferries, it will show you what gas percentage they arrive with and what is the last station visited before they board the ferry. In order to see the last station as "Large Ferry" or "Small Ferry", you can uncomment the line in VehicleAdding.cs. You will also see the amount of money collected by EACH FERRY and the amount of money collected by the Ticket Inspector once the ferry leaves. 
Other then that I hope you enjoy this simple simulation.
